Changes
=======

0.03 04 Feb 2004
  - Fix constructing with, and setting Japanese time components.
    (previously from_*() constructors would correctly calculate the
    time, but setting it or creating DT::C::Japanese with the time
    components didn't force a re-calculation of the underlying time)
  - Accomodate for fixes in DateTime::Calendar::Japanese::Era 0.04
  - Doc tweaks

0.02 24 Jan 2004
  - Set default time zone to "Asia/Tokyo"
  - Require DateTime::Calendar::Chinese 0.02, which fixes a lot of bugs
    and has elapsed_years()
  - Require DateTime::Calendar::Japanese::Era 0.02, which fixes edge case
  - Redo era math.
  - Add/fix documentation

0.01 12 Jan 2004
